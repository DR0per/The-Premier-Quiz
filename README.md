## Bugs

I found one bug in my code that stops the website from working 100% as intended. The quiz should automatically submit once the timer runs to 0, but afer many attempts at fixing the bug I could not get it to work correctly.

## Deployment 

The site was deployed to Github pages. The steps I took to deploy were as follows:

+ In my GitHub repository, navigate to Settings.
+ In code and automation section, click on the Pages button
+ In the GitHub Pages section, select Main Branch and root folder and click save.
+ From there the page will automatically refresh and a live link will appear.

## Credits 

+ The text for the Introductory Section was created using ChatGPT.
+ I relied heavily on the information that I learned throughout the Java Script Essentials modules with Code Institute.
+ I also learned alot from Coding Ninjas and Stack Overflow throughout this project.
+ I completed this project without the use of any Third Party Code so in my opinion that is the reason this website is basic but gets the job done.
