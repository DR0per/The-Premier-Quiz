### 4. Timer

+ The Timer starts at 2.00 and starts ticking down as soon as the page is loaded.

## Validator Testing

### 1. HTML

Throughout the course of building this website, I periodically tested each page and feature on Desktop/Tablet and Mobile Devices.
As far as I am aware, all pages and features including the Tara's Treats Logo, NavBar, Products Section hover effect and clickable Links, the Footer hover effects and clickable links, the Treats section and hover effects including CSS styling rules which hide certain images when viewed on mobile devices and the Contact form are all 100% working on all devices. 

I tested them myself on 3 seperate devices and I got friends and family to open the sites on their devices and the results are the same. All pages and features work as intended on Desktop/Tablet/Mobile Devices. 

There were no errors returned when passing through the official W3C validator.
